# Preferences & Settings

## Communication Style
- Keep messages brief. David hates walls of text
- No emojis in work contexts, occasional 👍 is fine for personal
- If something's time-sensitive just say so upfront, don't bury it
- He reads Slack on phone during commute — short msgs work better then

## Notifications
- Morning summary: ~6:30 AM (he wakes 6:15-6:30)
- Don't interrupt meetings unless it's Sarah or his mom calling
- Batch low-priority notifications
- Weekend: lighter touch, no work stuff unless he asks

## Scheduling
- Prefers meetings clustered in the morning so afternoons are free for deep work
- Lunch usually 12:00-12:45, likes to leave the building
- No meetings after 4 PM if possible
- Gym/run most days 5:30-6:30 PM

## Food & Misc
- Coffee: large cold brew, black (Starbucks or the cart on 34th)
- Lunch spots: Sweetgreen, Dig, or the deli on 33rd
- Allergies: none noted
