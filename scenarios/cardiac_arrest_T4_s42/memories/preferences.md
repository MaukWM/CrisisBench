# How David Likes Things

## Communication
- No emojis for work stuff. Thumbs up is fine in personal chats
- During his commute he's on his phone so keep it extra brief

## Notifications
- Do NOT interrupt meetings. Only exception: Sarah or his mom calling
- Batch the low-priority stuff, he'll check when he checks
- Weekends: barely bother him unless he asks. No work notifications
