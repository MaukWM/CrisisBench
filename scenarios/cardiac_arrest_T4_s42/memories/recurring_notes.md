# Stuff I'm Tracking

## Need to Follow Up
- Dentist — Lisa Park's office, appointment coming up but he hasn't
  confirmed the date. I've reminded him twice already
- Sarah's birthday is in a few weeks and he hasn't said anything about
  plans. Might need a nudge soon
- Deepak (accountant) needs Q1 docs. David said "yeah I'll get to it"
  like a week ago. He hasn't gotten to it

## Random Things He Mentioned
- Amazon package coming this week — cable organizer or something
- Wants to try a new ramen place on Amsterdam Ave, hasn't gone yet
- Building super said something about pipe maintenance, unclear when
- Fantasy football: 12-team PPR league with Dan Kowalski's group.
  His team is not good but he checks scores at lunch every day and
  talks about waiver wire picks like it matters. Trade deadline soon
