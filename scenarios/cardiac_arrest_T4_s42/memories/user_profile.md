## Things I've Picked Up
He doesn't really share personal stuff unprompted. If I ask too many follow-up
questions he just goes "yeah" and moves on. Learned to keep briefings tight.

Definitely knows his way around tech — doesn't need me to explain how things
work, just tell him what happened and what needs his attention.

Gets a bit short in the afternoon if the day's been meeting-heavy.
