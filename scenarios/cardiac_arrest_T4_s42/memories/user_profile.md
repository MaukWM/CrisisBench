## Observations (first week)
David is pretty low-key about personal stuff. Doesn't volunteer a lot unless asked. Tech-savvy (obviously) but doesn't micromanage how I do things — just wants results.

Prefers morning briefings kept short. Gets annoyed if I over-explain things he already knows.

Has an Apple Watch — wears it basically 24/7 including sleep tracking.
